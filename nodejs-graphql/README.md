# nodejs-graphql

Boilerplate setup for nodejs REST API backend

To set up locally

1. Fork/Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with &nbsp; `yarn`, &nbsp; If you don't have yarn installed on your system, run &nbsp; `sudo npm i -g yarn` &nbsp; to install it.
3. Install nvm (if you dont have already) and also install the node version used in the project
4. run `nvm use` to use the node version of the project (it would be for each terminal session separately), or else you can set that node version as default from nvm
5. Use the &nbsp; `package.json` &nbsp; to get to know about scripts to run and codebase structure
